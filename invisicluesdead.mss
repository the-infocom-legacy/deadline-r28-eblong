Some advice
@begin{itemize}
Like all good detectives throughout history, you will have to do a lot
of legwork.  You should check out the house and all of the grounds, examine everything, analyze everything, check for fingerprints, etc.;
you must be diligent.  If you suspect Ebullion in the sugar, have it
analyzed for Ebullion.  In general, it is a good idea to ask each of the
characters about all of the others.  Sometimes by comparing stories you
can learn something.  Keep an organized record of the results of your
investigation. 

Read very carefully the Inspectors Casebook which came with the game. 
Also be sure to read and refer to the Coroner's examination, the letter
from Coates, and the police interviews with those who knew the deceased
well. 

If you find out anything which may contradict what someone has said or
which might be of interest to them, ask them about it, show it to them,
or confront them with it.

If anyone acts suspiciously, follow them.  Watch what they do.

Much of what you need to learn will only come out if you keep after the
suspects in a "Colombo-like" way (in other words, putting pressure on
them until they react).
@end{itemize}

Communicating with Deadline
@begin{itemize}
Some people find it frustrating when their words or sentence structures
are not understood.  The Infocom series of games are considered to have
the best language handling ability of any programs available for
microcomputers.  Deadline is the best of this elite group.  However,
probably due to its real-life setting, some players expect more
understanding.  A careful reading of the Inspector's Casebook,
especially with respect to "Dealing with Suspects" and "Commonly
Encountered Terms," should be very helpful.  Once you get the hang of
it, the limitations will disappear.

medication for it.
                                   He had made plans for the next day.

He had spoken of suicide.          It wouldn't be much of a game if
                                   it were only a suicide.
There were problems with his
company, son, and wife.
@end{format}

Is there anything significant in the library?
@begin{itemize}
Examine everything...

... including the balcony, carpet, tray, bowl, cup, saucer, bookshelves,
calendar, notepad, and wastebasket.
@end{itemize}

What should I do with the bowl?
@begin{itemize}
Did you analyze it for Ebullion?

It seems that no one spiked the sugar.
@end{itemize}

Is the notepad important?
@begin{itemize}
Develop Hidden Question 3.
@end{itemize}

What should I do with the calendar?
@begin{itemize}
"A desk calendar is here, open to July 7."

Don't desk calendars customarily have more than one page?

You can say "Turn to July 15."  (or any other date)

Did you find anything interesting?

Do you think any of the other characters might be interested
(particularly those affected by a change in the will)?

If you show George the calendar entry concerning the new will in the
afternoon, he reacts very strangely.  Develop Hidden Question 5.
@end{itemize}

What happened to the chair Mr. Robner was sitting on?
@begin{itemize}
Artistic license?

There is no good reason for it to be missing.  Presumably the author
didn't consider it important.
@end{itemize}

Is the wastebasket important?
@begin{itemize}
Nothing much of interest here ...

More interesting is what is @b{not} here.
@end{itemize}

What is the significance of the telephone call?
@begin{itemize}
Did you try answering the phone when it rings at around 9 am?

Did Mrs. Robner do anything suspicious afterwards?

Did you try listening to her call on an extension phone?

Develop Hidden Question 1.
@end{itemize}

Are the paintings important?
@begin{itemize}
It appears that the Robners were collectors of fine art.

Some of the paintings appear to be quite valuable.

Particularly the Seurat.

Are there any paintings missing?

Do the paintings conceal anything?
@end{itemize}

What is the significance of the mail?
@begin{itemize}
The mail arrives shortly after N:00.

You only have about an hour before Mrs. Rourke will come across it and
deliver it.

Develop Hidden Question 2.
@end{itemize}

Is the newspaper important?
@begin{itemize}
Presumably you have read it.

"The Daily Herald is a local paper in two sections."

Did you read the second section?  (Alternatively, read the paper slowly
or carefully.)

Once again, you might want to show this to others for their reactions.

Have we seen a mention of Omnidyne before?
@end{itemize}

Is the book useful for anything?
@begin{itemize}
Did you try to read it?

Did you try to read the ending?
@end{itemize}

Are all of the drugs in the house significant?
@begin{itemize}
There certainly are a lot of them.

Have you read all the labels?

You should ask the other characters about them, particularly those who
are taking them.
@end{itemize}

Once Baxter has left, how do I find him?
@begin{itemize}
It's too late to do anything with Baxter.  You had 6 hours to deal with
him. 
@end{itemize}

How do I question Mr. Coates?
@begin{itemize}
Have you tried calling him on the phone?

Unfortunately, he is too preoccupied to speak to you before the will
reading. 

You won't get anywhere with this; Coates is just not available for you
to question.
@end{itemize}

Is Steven's arrival important?
@begin{itemize}
Did you follow him?

Did you eavesdrop on his conversation about the paintings?

How did you do these things when he never arrived?

***This space intentionally left blank.*** <Very Large>
@end{itemize}

Where did Mr. Robner keep important documents?
@begin{itemize}
If he kept any at home, they're well-hidden.

Might there be a hidden safe?  (You could ask the residents.)

You won't be able to find his documents yourself.  One of the characters
will reveal the location if you cause him/her to panic.

Investigate the desk calendar and proceed from there.
@end{itemize}

Is the fireplace important?
@begin{itemize}
No.
@end{itemize}

What is the significance of the fragment?
@begin{itemize}
Develop Hidden Question 24.
@end{itemize}

Is Ms. Rourke useful for anything?
@begin{itemize}
She seems to be a good housekeeper.

She is a bit of a gossip though.

She could get into trouble sticking her nose into her employers'
affairs. 
@end{itemize}

How do I open the kitchen window?
@begin{itemize}
It won't open.
@end{itemize}

Who can show me the cellar entrance?
@begin{itemize}
Shouldn't any one of the residents be able to do this?

How long could you live in a house without knowing the layout?

What led you to believe there was a cellar?
@end{itemize}

Is there a new will?
@begin{itemize}
You might ask the characters about it.

Mr. Coates says that Mr. Robner told him he was altering the old one.

Mr. Robner's calendar indicates that he wrote one.
@end{itemize}

How do I get back down from the attic?
@begin{itemize}
Who took the ladder?

Did you hide behind the trunk to watch who took it?

This could be important.  Is there something you said or did which could
cause this to happen?

How did you get into the attic?
@end{itemize}

What is the quickest way to summon Mr. Robner's brother?
@begin{itemize}
His brother Clement?

Have you tried the phone?

Where might the phone number be?

Did you ask Duffy to find him?

What brother?
@end{itemize}

Is Clement's grief sincere?
@begin{itemize}
What indication do you have that it isn't?

Isn't a single smirk a rather small thread with which to build a case?

Who the #@@%* is Clement?
@end{itemize}

Is Mr. McNabb useful for anything?
@begin{itemize}
He apparently is a good gardener.

Have you talked to him?  (He's not much of a conversationalist on topics
unrelated to gardening, but if you ask him about the weather, his roses,
or the lawn, ....)

Have you ever noticed a change in him?

Shortly after 11:00 am he becomes quite annoyed.  Why?  Ask him.

Ask him to show you the holes he is ranting about.
@end{itemize}

What is the ladder for?
@begin{itemize}
You might ask Mr. McNabb.

In general, ladders are useful for getting to and from high places.

Do you think it would reach the balcony?
@end{itemize}

Is there any significance to George's long vigil at the lake in the
afternoon? 
@begin{itemize}
Did you notice any suspicious behavior before this?

Try looking into the lake where he is standing.
@end{itemize}

How do I leave the grounds?
@begin{itemize}
You don't.  The geography certainly can't go on forever.
@end{itemize}

@newpage
@center{@b{Develop Only If ...}}

In this section, develop the clues @b{only} if the condition is met.

Someone acted strangely at the will reading or soon after:
@begin{itemize}
If this person left in a hurry, go on.

Develop Hidden Question 5.
@end{itemize}

You have analyzed the footprint:
@begin{itemize}
Develop Hidden Question 25.
@end{itemize}

You have found a couple of holes:
@begin{itemize}
Continue only if you have found a pair of holes in the rose garden.

What might fit in them?

Try the ladder (remember that it rained Wednesday night).

There was a way into and/or out of the library, despite the locked door.
It would be a good idea to search the area carefully.

Search around the holes again.
@end{itemize}

If you have found a destroyed document:
@begin{itemize}
How do you think it got there?

Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously earlier?

The document didn't just appear in the water.  George got it from
somewhere and threw it there.

He began acting strangely when he realized there was a new will which
Mr. Coates didn't know about.

Follow him when he first starts acting strangely.  Develop Hidden
Question 5.
@end{itemize}

If you have found the hidden closet:
@begin{itemize}
Develop Hidden Question 6.
@end{itemize}

After you have discovered the missing paintings:
@begin{itemize}
Don't go on if you haven't been in the cellar.

Why do I get the distinct impression that you are cheating?
@end{itemize}

If someone (other than Mr. Robner) has died:
@begin{itemize}
If it is Ms. Dunbar, go on.  Otherwise, don't develop any further.

Develop Hidden Question 27 and then continue with the next hint for this
question. 

Did anything peculiar happen before this apparent suicide?

Did anyone other than George, Mr. Coates, Duffy, or you leave the house?

Did you follow?  (or watch from the guest room window?)

Mr. Baxter and Ms. Dunbar met in the tool shed.  What happened there?

Did you watch through the tool shed window?  Try looking through several
times during the course of the discussion.

Might this suicide be a murder?

Did you notice anything odd about the scene of the "suicide"?

Where is the pen Dunbar used to write the suicide note?

Develop Hidden Questions 7 and 8.
@end{itemize}

You have found a diary:
@begin{itemize}
If it is Mrs. Robner's diary, go on.  Otherwise, don't develop any
further. 

Don't unlock it until you are positive it is Mrs. Robner's.

Did you find the key under Mrs. Robner's mattress?

Somehow I get the distinct impression that you are cheating.
@end{itemize}

You have solid proof of the method of Mr. Robner's death:
@begin{itemize}
If you don't have the lab report, don't go on.

Develop Hidden Questions 10 through 18.
@end{itemize}

You have entered the attic:
@begin{itemize}
Develop Hidden Question 26.
@end{itemize}

@newpage
@center{@b{Hidden Questions}}

Develop the numbered questions only when you are directed to in other
parts of this booklet.

1.  When should I listen to Leslie's phone call?
@begin{itemize}
If you listen in on the extension, you will hear the same conversation
every time.  There is no way to hear more of the conversation.
@end{itemize}

2.  What is in the envelope?
@begin{itemize}
You won't find out without opening it, illegal and immoral though that
may be.

It appears that Mrs. Robner had a motive for killing her husband.

Have you shown the letter to anyone?  It mentions others by name.
@end{itemize}

3.  What do I do with the notepad?
@begin{itemize}
This is something you should examine carefully.

Is there a way you might make sense of the indentations?

What would Sherlock Holmes do?  (You've probably done it yourself as a
child). 

Cary Grant did it in Alfred Hitchcock's @u{North by Northwest}.

Try rubbing the notepad with the pencil (alternatively, you can hold it
up to the light).

Develop Hidden Question 4.
@end{itemize}

4.  What do the indentations on the notepad say?
@begin{itemize}
It is clearly a note from Marshall Robner to Mr. Baxter.

It seems a rather forceful note.

It appears that Marshall is insisting that Baxter do something
concerning a merger.  There is also some apparent mention of documents
and something about "Focus."

"@ @ plica" could be part of replicate or implicate ....

The last line looks like "Reconsider before it is too late!"

Have you asked the other characters about the merger and Focus?

You might want to show certain people the note also.

Isn't it interesting that Baxter claims he never received the note yet
it isn't in the wastebasket?

<Put the exact text of the note here if we can get it from Marc>
@end{itemize}

5.  What is George up to?
@begin{itemize}
Did you follow him?

Did you try to hide so you could watch?

Try hiding in the upstairs closet.

Now that you know he disappeared in the library, you might hide there
next time to see what he does.

Hide on the balcony.

Now that you have seen someone enter the Hidden Closet, you can discover
the way to get in - examine the bookshelves.  (Alternatively, you could
have found the way in without seeing George enter if you did a
@b{careful} examination at some time after George has entered and left
the button uncovered by books.)
@end{itemize}

6.  How do I open the safe?
@begin{itemize}
Have you asked anyone for the combination?

No one will admit to knowing it.

Do you believe no one knows?

What was George doing in the Hidden Closet?

You must time your entry to the Hidden Closet so that you catch George
with the safe open.

By the way, don't forget to look inside the safe.
@end{itemize}

7.  Who murdered Ms. Dunbar?
@begin{itemize}
Who had a motive?

Who has the pen which wrote the "suicide" note?

Ask the suspects for a pen.

When you get one, try writing with it.
@end{itemize}

8.  How did the murderer get to Ms. Dunbar?
@begin{itemize}
You might try hiding in the hall closet to see where he comes from.

If you surprise him in the master bedroom or on the master bedroom
balcony, you will be killed.

Baxter used the ladder to reach the master bedroom balcony.

Develop Hidden Question 9.
@end{itemize}

9.  Is this the proper ending of the game?
@begin{itemize}
Do you feel satisfied?

Don't you think you can solve the case without Dunbar being murdered?
@end{itemize}

10.  Was it suicide?
@begin{itemize}
You must be kidding!

<big space>***This space intentionally left blank.***
@end{itemize}

11.  What do I need to get a conviction?
@begin{itemize}
You need a good case.  There must be a clear motive, means of
administering the drug and removing the evidence, no alibi,
and no inconsistencies.
@end{itemize}

12.  How can I prove that Mr. Baxter was involved?
@begin{itemize}
You'll have to come up with a motive.  Develop Hidden Question 19.

He has a good alibi for the night of the crime.  You'll have to destroy
it.  Develop Hidden Question 20.

You must also prove he had the means to carry out the crime.  Develop Hidden
Question 21.
@end{itemize}

13.  How can I prove George is guilty?
@begin{itemize}
You'll need a solid motive.

"Love of money is the root of all evil."

A threatened change in the will would be a good reason ....

Have you shown him the calendar entry concerning the new will?

You'll also have to prove that he had the means to carry out the crime.
Develop Hidden Question 22.
@end{itemize}

14.  How do I prove that Mrs. Robner is guilty?
@begin{itemize}
She certainly had a motive - Steven.

She also had a convenient balcony to re-enter the house without Mrs.
Rourke hearing her.

Was there any mud on her balcony or in her room?

How would she have gotten the Loblo into Mr. Robner's tea?

She couldn't do it alone.
@end{itemize}

15.  How do I convict Ms. Dunbar?
@begin{itemize}
What would her motive be?

She certainly had the opportunity to put her Loblo in the tea.

How did she re-enter the house without Mrs. Rourke hearing her?

She could not have done it alone.  You'll have to find a reason she
might help someone else.
@end{itemize}

16.  What was McNabb's motive?
@begin{itemize}
Is it possible that Mr. Robner stepped on a rosebush?

Be serious.  McNabb is certainly not a suspect.
@end{itemize}

17.  How did Steven get the Loblo capsules?
@begin{itemize}
This is a red herring.

***This space intentionally left blank.***

***This space intentionally left blank.***

<very big space>***This space intentionally left blank.***
@end{itemize}

18.  What caused the bruise on Mr. Robner's left temple?
@begin{itemize}
It is interesting that it was the left temple given that the body way
lying on the right side on the floor.

It is possible that Mr. Robner hit his head on the desk as he fell.

It is also possible that the body was moved for some reason.

There is no evidence which will allow a definite answer to this.  It will
remain a mystery forever.
@end{itemize}

19.  How do I prove a motive for Mr. Baxter?
@begin{itemize}
There is an item of interest in the library.

Check out the notepad.

It appears that Baxter was involved with something called Focus.  You
will need to find the documents referred to in the note.
@end{itemize}

20.  How can Baxter's alibi be destroyed?
@begin{itemize}
In his police interview, he said he was at the concert alone.

Before continuing, show Ms. Dunbar the lab report and follow up on the
subsequent developments.

Develop Hidden Question 28.
@end{itemize}

21.  How did Baxter carry out the murder?
@begin{itemize}
How could he have gotten the Loblo into Mr. Robner's tea?

He had to have an accomplice.

Ms. Dunbar delivered the tea and is obviously romantically involved with
Baxter. 
@end{itemize}

22.  How did George carry out the murder?
@begin{itemize}
How did he get the Loblo into the tea?

How did he re-enter the house without Mrs. Rourke hearing him (or is she
lying?)? 
@end{itemize}

23.  Why is this question here?
@begin{itemize}
If you thought there were no more questions,

you might be able to deduce

something you should not yet know.

This way,

before you have developed @b{every} hint,

the fact that this question remained undeveloped

implied that one of the remaining hints was very important.

<big box if room>  But obviously it wasn't.
@end{itemize}

24.  What do I do with the fragment?
@begin{itemize}
Did you clean it off and examine it?

Do you recall anything similar?

Didn't you examine the teacup in the library or those in the kitchen?

If you count the teacups and saucers in the kitchen, you'll notice a
teacup is missing.

Could the teacup in the library be a substitute?

The fragment ought to be analyzed.

What might the chemical which "is not a common medication" be?

One of the bottles of medicine was from another country.

Have the fragment analyzed for the medication you suspect.

Say "Analyze the fragment for Loblo."
@end{itemize}

25.  What does the shoe size and depth indicate?
@begin{itemize}
See the answer to Hidden Question 26.
@end{itemize}

26.  Who put the stolen Rembrandt here?
@begin{itemize}
See the answer to Hidden Question 25.
@end{itemize}

27.  Why is there both a living and a dead Ms. Dunbar?
@begin{itemize}
Do you remember Dunbar referring to her identical twin sister?

Wasn't Mrs. Robner an expert on make-up and impersonations during her
early theatrical career?

Wasn't Clement a plastic surgeon?

This was a very funny bug in the early versions of the game.
@end{itemize}

28.  Is the ticket stub meaningful?
@begin{itemize}
If you show Baxter the ticket stub, he admits that he was at the concert
with Ms. Dunbar but says that she became ill at intermission and took a
cab home.

Dunbar originally said she was "out with a friend and we didn't get back
until 10:30."

If Dunbar is confronted with the ticket stub (and she wasn't present
when you showed it to Mr. Baxter), she says "... we go to concerts, only
occasionally, you understand.  We went that night, the night Marshall
died.  @b{And then he took me home} and that's it."

So, Baxter @b{was} at the Robner home Wednesday night but lied about it.
@end{itemize}
